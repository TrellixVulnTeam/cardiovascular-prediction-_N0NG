  The training opportunity I had with iSMRITI at LPU Jalandhar was a great chance for learning and enhancing my technical skills. I consider myself as lucky to have been provided an opportunity by the Punjabi University, Patiala to do training in a leading technology of today. I am also grateful to the University’s Computer Science Department for guiding me and helping to find training as per my need. I express my deepest gratitude and thanks to Mr. Vipul Arora (IIT Kanpur), Course Coordinator at Excellence Technology who in spite of being extraordinarily busy with his schedule took time out to solve my doubts, guide and keep me on the correct path and allowing to me carry out my project at their esteemed organization during the training. I perceive this opportunity as a big milestone in my career development. I will strive to use gained skills and knowledge in the best possible way, and I will continue to work on their improvement, in order to attain desired career objectives.

 # INTRODUCTION 
  
  <p>
  This is a web-based simple to use cardiovascular diseases stage prediction application that can predict the health status of your heart with the help of Deep learning algorithm. This model is trained over 70000+ original data and statics of different humans and their health factor that we are using to train our model like blood pressure, diabetes or not, smoke or not, age, height etc. 
I created this web-based app using flask that is a python-based web app development framework. It gives a simple cool interface so that anyone can simple create account and register and then he/she can fill the details of his/her and then can check the heart health status with the corresponding suggestion. 
I’m using keras to train the model. Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. 
Also, I’m suing data representation to analysis the dataset and other features of the data set. In the following report I’ll show, you the graphs and other stats of dataset.
